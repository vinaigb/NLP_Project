# NLP_Project

The project is about text summarization using BART, a powerful transformer-based model, in generating concise and coherent summaries from complex input texts. The clustering of similar summarized outputs enabled a comparative evaluation of summarization models. The implementation of a question-answering pipeline showcased the effectiveness of various language models, such as BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, and ALBERT.
